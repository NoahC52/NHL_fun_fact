# NHL_fun_fact
# INFO 
So this is a simple project designed to give fun facts about the 7 various NHL teams I have selected.
# REASON
This was designed as a way for me to test various things I have been teaching myself in Python.
It explores various things from functions, if, else, and elif statements, while loops, dictionaries, and finally well documented code.

I'm pretty happy with it and I hope you have fun testing it. :)
